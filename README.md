## Project monty ## 

The program monty is a local interpreter created to interpret the Monty language.

The program is run with following syntax:
` monty <file> `
where *<file>* is the path to a file containing a valid Monty bytecode.

The monty program has currently implemented the following functionalities:
* push - adds an int to the top of a stack_t stack
* pall - prints all the elements of a stack_t stack
* pop - deletes an element from the top of a stack_t stack
* swap - swaps the top two elements of a stack_t stack
* add - adds the last two elements of a stack_t stack and stores the result in the top second position of the stack
* nop - does nothing
